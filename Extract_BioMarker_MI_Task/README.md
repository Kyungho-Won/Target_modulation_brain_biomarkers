# Extraction Biomarker of Motor Imagery Task
>This is the AI-based Brain Signal Processing Algorithm - Motor Function project. They consist of EEG signal classification and dataset loading code. It is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for signal processing and classification on motor imagery, written in PyTorch and Tensorflow.  It also contains code for loading multiple datasets written in MATLAB.

This is a schematic diagram of the proposed CNN-LSTM model. We propose a new model by referring to the following paper: Zhang, Ruilong, et al. "Hybrid deep neural network using transfer learning for EEG motor imagery decoding." Biomedical Signal Processing and Control 63 (2021): 102144.
